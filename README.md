# ChaDevelopmentEnvironment

This script will install VScode or VScodium with GNU c++ build tools. Everything is made with relative paths and does not install anything to your path. The total size after install is around 1.5Gb.

You only need to [download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raynoxu1337/ChaDE/main/MakeChaDevEnv.ps1) (Rightclick save link as) and run the MakeChaDevEnv.ps1 script. The script will install the ChaDE in the same folder it is located in.
